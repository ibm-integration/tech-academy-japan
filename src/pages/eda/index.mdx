## Synopsis

  1. Advise the Client on the use of Event-Driven/Near Real-time **Integration Patterns, Technologies** and Implementation Strategies.
  2. This session was designed with the recognition that **not every student will have the same level of knowledge** of IBM Event Streams or event-driven architecture.
  3. **Beginner Journey**:  Complete an end-to-end demo (A-to-Z) off the IBM Event Streams offering deployed in CP4i
  4. **Advanced Journey**:  Develop an event-driven / near real-time inventory management MVP solution.
  5. Consider the content in this session to material that enables an ‘on-going learning journey’ experience.

## Goals

  - Develop a deeper understand and knowledge of key event-driven use cases, event-drive architecture patterns, and near real-time integration patterns.

  - Develop a core understanding of the main components that make up the IBM Events Stream offering.

  - Develop knowledge and skills that can be used to explain how an event-driven integration approach can be used to solve a client’s IT and business goals.

  - Develop skills that can be used to assess a set of client requirements or PoC goals and propose an event-driven solution approach.

  - Develop skill that can be used to demonstrate the IBM Event Streams offering.

## Guidelines

  - This session was designed with the recognition that not every student will have the same level of knowledge of IBM Event Streams or event-driven architecture.

  - This session was designed with **two (2) entry points** or tracks that a student can follow depending on skill level.
    - *Beginner Journey*:  This Journey is an entry level starting point and offers a **Demonstration Event Stream from A to Z** experience.  This option offers a well scripted demo flow that covers all key aspects of IBM Event Streams on CP4i.
    - *Advanced Journey*:  This Journey 2 is a more advanced entry point and covers a **full body of knowledge** within the near real-time / event driven architecture domain.  This Journey will have four (4) labs that progressively build out an MVP prototype supporting DoU defined goals and objectives.

  - Students are **free to choose** their entry point for the Tech Academy lab work.

  - Between Journey 1 and Journey 2 there may be **more content to cover** then can be completed in this 4-hour session.  With that in mind, consider using this material as an **on-going learning activity** post Academy.
