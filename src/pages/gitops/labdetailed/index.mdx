## Lab Overview

Have you received requests to deliver a Multi-style Integration demo or PoC, and you don’t know how to quickly prepare this environment? You are on the right place. In this session,  you will learn how to prepare a demo/PoC environment using GitOps automation framework. This environment will include different assets, capabilities, services and applications of IBM Cloud Pak for Integration.

The first main goal of this session is to provide you a complete CP4I environment with multiple demo assets to be ready to progress your sales opportunity. This first goal is achieved by reusing a <a href="https://github.ibm.com/joel-gomez/cp4i-demo" target="_blank">multi-style integration demo assets</a>.

The second goal is to provide this environment quickly and easily, by using the GitOps automation framework, more details <a href="https://production-gitops.dev/" target="_blank">here</a> about Cloud Pak Production Deployment Guides.

This document was created for Senior Technical Specialists, and we know you are one of them. Because of that, instead to have very detailled steps, we have high level directions about what you need to do. There are some challenges that we don't explain how to do them, but we are pretty sure that you can do it! But let the proctors know if you have any issue to complete the challenges.

As part of the evalution process of this session, at the end, you will need to capture and upload screenshots of your final progress. In this document, you will see some references about the necessary screenshots.

In this session you will learn:
  - the IBM opinionated point of view regarding a GitOps centric method to manage RHOCP infrastructure, IBM integration software and application workload code (three tier GitOps architecture).
  - how to develop, review, and extend an IBM GitOps automation repository that incapsulate key software components within the IBM Integration portfolio.
  - how to position a GitOps automation framework as a key boot-strapping and operational mechanism supporting a Client PoC activity and Client adoption.

***

## Prerequisites

- You need to have an OpenShift environment with GitOps operators. For this session, your proctor will provide you a pre-installed environment, with admin access (more details below). If you want to create your personal environment, check this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmDE80vuP3w" target="_blank">video</a> or follow the preparation section from this <a href="https://github.com/sko-master/multi-tenancy-gitops/blob/master/doc/sko-scenario.md" target="_blank">documentation</a>.
- You need to have installed in your machine:
  - <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html" target="_blank">oc CLI</a> v4.6+.
  - github CLI
  - Bash Shell
  - JAVA v8+
  - <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/" target="_blank">jq CLI</a>
- You need to have a SalesForce account. This should have been completed as part of the <a href="https://ibm-garage-tsa.github.io/cp4i-demohub/salesdemos/carrepair-new/prepare/#setting-up-salesforce" target="_blank">Tech Academy pre-requisite work</a>.
- You need to have a mailtrap account. This too should have been completed as part of the <a href="https://mailtrap.io/" target="_blank">Tech Academy pre-requisite work</a>.
- You have access to GitHub Organization with all repositories. Your proctor will provide that for you.

## Business Context

This document describes multiple use cases that highlight the multi-style integration patterns needed by an Integration Specialist to implement a digital transformation initiative that showcase the value Cloud Pak for Integration can provide.

In this case a customer has a system of record that has used for many years which ws designed to work with MQ to process requirements, and now they want to extend the application to expose an API in a asecure way as part of their mobile app.

But the requirement doesn't end there, they are also implementing a new CRM system as a Service and they want to keep both systems in sync without having to modify the original system of record.

Additionally as part of their digital transformation initiative they want to stay closer to their clients and they want to send email notifications when the client is taking certain actions in their mobile app. To support this strategy, the enterprise architecture team wants to implement an event backbone, as part of their event driven architecture.

The following diagram provides a high level view of the scenario:
  ![](images/CP4I_MultiStyle_DemoScenario.png)

In order to implement this demo you will need to deploy an instance of each one of the following components in your OCP Cluster:
  - API Connect Cluster
  - Event Streams Cluster
  - Queue Manager
  - App Connect Enterprise Integration Servers

The following diagram provides a high level implementation view of the scenario with the core capabilities:
  ![](images/CP4I_MultiStyle_HighLevelView.png)

To demonstrate the added value capabilities provided by CP4I you will deploy an instance of the following components in your OCP Cluster:
  - Platform UI (formerly known as Platform Navigator)
  - Automation Foundation Assets (formerly known as Asset Repository)
  - Operations Dashboard

## Automation Framework Introduction

### What are the Production Deployment Guides?

The <a href="https://production-gitops.dev/" target="_blank">Cloud Pak Production Deployment Guides</a> document and demonstrate how to design, deploy and operate cloud-native solutions leveraging IBM Cloud Pak capabilities in Red Hat OpenShift environments. The guides focus on Production level qualities of services such as High Availability, Security and Performance including how to design, install and manage your Cluster in the popular managed and unmanaged Cloud environments as well as tackling disconnected or air-gapped environments.


### Production Deployment Guide objectives

There are a number of objectives behind providing the Production Deployment Guides. The three main goals of the Guides are provided below:
  - Provide opinionated, validated Production topologies
  - Provide a GitOps driven automation framework
  - Enable IBMers to setup Production topologies


### What is GitOps?

GitOps requires us to describe the entire system declaratively in Git where the desired system state is versioned, managed and applied by software agents.

Automation is key for scale in the Cloud world and OpenShift and Cloud Paks are no different. The implementation code and artifacts provided along with these guides are based on a GitOps approach where infrastructure and everything deployed in to an OpenShift Cluster (including Cloud Paks) is described as code and is managed in the same way that application code would be.

More information on the gitops structure can be read in this <a href="https://production-gitops.dev/gitops/structure/" target="_blank">page</a>.

## Lab Environment

For this session you will use a ROKS 4.8 environment with 5 nodes (b3c.16x64). Following this video, you can have a personal environment for you, including GitOps operator and configuration. But for this section, your lab proctors pre-installed this cluster for you. They already installed GitOps, created an empty GitHub Organization and forked the automation repositories that you will use, for this empty organization (check the video to see the steps already completed).

Because of time restrictions, the proctors already installed some core services of Cloud Pak for Integration, avoiding you to wait almost 90 minutes to complete this installation. In the previous sections, you will check what are installed in this environment.

***

## 0 - Preparation

In this section you will do some initial steps to prepare your environment for the lab, including accept the Account Invitation in IBM Cloud, access your cluster web console and by command line interface. Let’s start it!

1. Log in <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/" target="_blank">IBM Cloud</a>.

2. Open the **Notifications** page (click on top right ring bell icon).

   `Notes`: You should have received an invitation for the GitHub Organization of your team. Don't forget to accept it in your Github account email.

   That is it! Now you are ready for the lab. Take a breath and enjoy your lab!

***

## 1 - Clone Repositories

1. As explained before, you already have Github repositories for your team. On previous section, you took notes of your GitHub organization's name. Now that you have the name, let's clone the repositories in your local machine. Back to the terminal window, use the command below to define your GIT_ORG variable.

```
export GIT_ORG={REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_GIT_ORG}
```

2. Now let's clone the repositories to your local machine.
```
mkdir ${GIT_ORG}
cd ${GIT_ORG}
git clone https://github.com/${GIT_ORG}/multi-tenancy-gitops
git clone https://github.com/${GIT_ORG}/multi-tenancy-gitops-infra
git clone https://github.com/${GIT_ORG}/multi-tenancy-gitops-services
git clone https://github.com/${GIT_ORG}/multi-tenancy-gitops-apps
```

3. You are welcome to explore all the four repositories of the GitOps Automation framework.


***

## 2 - Explore the Environment

Now that you have all the repositories locally, let's check what have been deployed.

1. Let's start by exploring the GitOps Automation Framework YAML files. First, let's check the kustomization.yaml in infra layer (/multi-tenancy-gitops/0-bootstrap/single-cluster/1-infra/).

```
vi multi-tenancy-gitops/0-bootstrap/single-cluster/1-infra/kustomization.yaml

```

  Check that **tools** and **ibm-common-services** are the namespaces enabled. We will explore these namespaces in OpenShift later. Go ahead and close vi.

![](images/explore1.png)

2. Let's explore the kustomization.yaml in services layer (/multi-tenancy-gitops/0-bootstrap/single-cluster/2-services/)

```
vi multi-tenancy-gitops/0-bootstrap/single-cluster/2-services/kustomization.yaml

```

  Here you can check that Platform Navigator, Asset Repository, API Connect and others are already installed in your environment. Don't worry, in next steps you will install other operators and create new instances.

![](images/explore2.png)

3. Let's check the installed operators in your Cluster Web Console. You should have the web console page opened, if not, there is a URL available in the Team Environments page.

  On Web Console page, open **Operators** (A), then **Installed Operators** (B). Here you can see all the installed operators (C).

![](images/explore3.png)

4. Now, let's open the ArgoCD UI. Let's get the ArgoCD Admin's password first. On Web Console page, open **Workloads** (A) > **Secrets** (B).

![](images/explore4_1.png)

   Filter by **openshift-gitops** project (A) and open the **openshift-gitops-cntk-cluster** (B).

![](images/explore4_2.png)

   Scroll down and click to copy the **admin.password**. You are welcome to take note of this password.

![](images/explore4_3.png)

5. Now, let's get the ArgoCD URL. Open **Networking** (A) and **Routes** (B).

![](images/explore5_1.png)

   Click on the **openshift-gitops-cntk-server** location to open the ArgoCD URL.

![](images/explore5_2.png)

  If necessary, accept all the risks, and log in with **admin** user and the password that you copied in the previous step. `Note:` Don't log in via openshift, because your openshift user doesn't have write permission.

![](images/explore5_3.png)

6. Now, you are in Argo CD. Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Here you can see all the applications. In Argo CD, application definitions, configurations, and environments should be declarative and version controlled. Application deployment and lifecycle management should be automated, auditable, and easy to understand.

   As you can see, you have 20 **healthy** applications in your environment (A), including **ibm-platform-navigator** (B). You are welcome to explore the Applications tiles page to see the other applications available.

![](images/explore6.png)

7. Great, now let's check your Cloud Pak for Integration environment. First we need to get the Platform Navigator URL and password. Let's do it! Back to the OpenShift Web Console, open **Workloads** (A) and **Secrets** (B) again.

![](images/explore7_1.png)

   Now filter by **tools** project (A) and open the **ibm-iam-bindinfo-platform-auth-idp-credentials** secret (B).

![](images/explore7_2.png)

   Scroll down and click to copy the **admin_password**. You are welcome to take note of this password.

![](images/explore7_3.png)

8. Now, let's get the Platform Navigator URL. Open **Networking** (A) and **Routes** (B).

![](images/explore8_1.png)

   Scroll down and click on the **integration-navigator-pn** location to open the Platform Navigator.

![](images/explore8_2.png)

   If necessary, accept all the risks, and click **IBM provided credentials (admin only)** link.

![](images/explore8_3.png)

   Log in with **admin** user and the password that you copied in the previous step.

![](images/explore8_4.png)

9. Now, let's explore the CP4I. Close the **Welcome** dialog.

![](images/explore9_1.png)

   Let's check the instances available. Click on **Integration instances** link.

![](images/explore9_2.png)

   Great, here you can check that your API Management (including Gateway and Admin), Automation Assets and Integration tracing are **Ready** to be used.

![](images/explore9_3.png)

```

4. Back to the argoCD console, refresh the **03-Application** application. Maybe you need to wait few minutes to make sure that all the status are Sync and Healthy, before progressing.

![](images/es-4_1.png)

   When completed, you should have **27** healthy applications (A), including *eventstream* (B).

![](images/es-4_2.png)

5. Open the **eventstream** application.

![](images/es-5_1.png)

   Open the **es-demo-setup-job-???** pod.

![](images/es-5_2.png)

   Open the **LOGS** tab.

![](images/es-5_3.png)

6. You should see a failure that statefulsets.apps is forbidden.

![](images/es-6_1.png)

   Let's fix it! Back to the terminal window, go to the *multi-tenancy-gitops-apps* folder and edit the file below.
```
cd ../multi-tenancy-gitops-apps/
vi sko-sample/eventstream/es-demo-setup-job-sa-role.yaml

## 8 - Customize APIC

Now, let's create the Provider Organization and Publish the API in APIC.

1. Go to the folder **multi-tenancy-gitops-apps/sko-sample/apic-cust**.
```
cd ../multi-tenancy-gitops-apps/sko-sample/apic-cust

```


2. Now let's configure APIC to submit emails when necessary (e.g.: Portal Users registration). Run the script to generate the APIC mail secret using Mailtrap. Where:
   - MAILTRAP_USER is *[Mailtrap SMTP User]*
   - MAILTRAP_PWD is *[Mailtrap SMTP Password]*

```
MAILTRAP_USER=<user> MAILTRAP_PWD=<pwd> ./apic-user-mail-secret.sh
```

3. Check that you have a Secret YAML file in your folder.
```
ls *secret.yaml
```

4. In the multi-tenancy-gitops-apps folder: Add, Commit and Push the changes to multi-tenancy-gitops repository.
```
cd ../../
git add .
git commit -m "apic user mail secret"
git push origin
```

5. Go to the *multi-tenancy-gitops* folder and edit the file **multi-tenancy-gitops/0-bootstrap/single-cluster/3-apps/kustomization.yaml**.
```
cd ../multi-tenancy-gitops/
vi 0-bootstrap/single-cluster/3-apps/kustomization.yaml
```


6. In the *SKO sample apps* section, uncomment the line below. Then save and close the YAML file.

Check <a href="https://youtu.be/oTrtd9eKU8E" target="blank">this video</a> later, if you want to learn how to deliver a demo using this demo environment.

So far we have focused on the "runtime" aspect of the deployment, but to provide a full demo experience, in some cases you will need to walk a customer through the assets that make up the demo scenario. If you want to have the developer experience in your demo/POC, check <a href="https://github.ibm.com/joel-gomez/cp4i-demo#developer-experience" target="_blank">here</a> how to do it.
