## Guidelines

  1. **Client Facing**:  Consider the useability or practicality for using this framework to support an IBM Integration sales opportunity.
     - a) Easier option for a Tech Seller to create and deliver a client facing demo.
     - b) Potential to accelerate the time and effort required to get a PoC up and running.
     - c) Communicate the extended value of RHOP as part of an IBM Integration transaction.
     - d) Demonstration of the power of containers, container orchestration, operators, DevSecOps automation, and Day-2 operations.

  2. **Internal**:  Can this framework enable the Technical Sales Professional to be more efficient and effective in the field?
     - a) Will this asset make it easier to have a demo environment up and running and scale-able to accept release updates?
     - b) Will this asset make it easier for a Tech Seller to have their own, self managed demo configuration?
     - c) Will this asset make it easier for a Tech Seller to embrace containers, orchestration, and DevOps principles?
