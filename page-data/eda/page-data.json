Advise the Client on the use of Event-Driven/Near Real-time **Integration Patterns, Technologies** and Implementation Strategies.\n  2. This session was designed with the recognition that **not every student will have the same level of knowledge** of IBM Event Streams or event-driven architecture.\n  3. **Beginner Journey**:  Complete an end-to-end demo (A-to-Z) off the IBM Event Streams offering deployed in CP4i\n  4. **Advanced Journey**:  Develop an event-driven / near real-time inventory management MVP solution.\n  5. Consider the content in this session to material that enables an ‘on-going learning journey’ experience.\n\n***\n\n## Resources & Presentations\n\n  - <a href=\"https://ibm.box.com/s/qw5tvrijqw5gd8qjy4cxxxrml8qo7lqj\" target=\"_blank\">Session Overview Presentation</a>\n  - <a href=\"https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/eda-tech-academy/\" target=\"_blank\">Lab Handout</a>\n\n***\n\n## Deliverables\n\n  1.

This option offers a well scripted demo flow that covers all key aspects of IBM Event Streams on CP4i.\n    - *Advanced Journey*:  This Journey 2 is a more advanced entry point and covers a **full body of knowledge** within the near real-time / event driven architecture domain.  This Journey will have four (4) labs that progressively build out an MVP prototype supporting DoU defined goals and objectives.\n\n  - Students are **free to choose** their entry point for the Tech Academy lab work.\n\n  - Between Journey 1 and Journey 2 there may be **more content to cover** then can be completed in this 4-hour session.  With that in mind, consider using this material as an **on-going learning activity** post Academy.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"27883fe5d53023f07713a5b735fb5c72","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":87},"frontmatter":{"title":"MVP Development using EDA Practices, Real-time Inventory Management"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: MVP Development using EDA Practices, Real-time Inventory Management\n---\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Synopsis</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Resources & Presentations</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Deliverables</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Goals</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Guidelines</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n***\n\n## Synopsis\n\n  1.
