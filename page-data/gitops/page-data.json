Advise client on Agile Integration techniques utilizing RedHat GitOps & Pipeline operators.\n  2. Advise client on the advantages of using GitOps automation to accelerate Cloud Pak adoption.\n  3. Advise client on the advantage for adopting containerized IBM Integration products using GitOps automation.\n  4. Position a GitOps Automation Framework to boot-strapping Client PoC activity.\n  5. Evaluate options to create and maintain your own set of demo environments, demo assets, demo scripts, and automation scripts.\n\n\n***\n\n## Resources & Presentations\n\n  - <a href=\"https://ibm.box.com/s/6oj1vcm8ppziw9xyug0985c85m4qjey6\" target=\"_blank\">Session Overview Presentation</a>\n  - <a href=\"https://ibm.box.com/s/5buzanhqf0em1ydg15y3rih8vna1hrmc\" target=\"_blank\">GitOps Automation Framework Presentation</a>\n  - [Lab Handout](/gitops/lab/)\n\n\n***\n\n## Deliverables\n\n  1.
